# Task 5: Movie Recommendation System

This task involves the development of a movie recommendation system using the Jupyter Notebook `Recommend_Movie.ipynb`. The notebook demonstrates the implementation of recommendation algorithms to suggest movies based on user preferences or historical data.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Recommendation Algorithms**: Implementation of collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessing the performance of the recommendation system using metrics like precision, recall, and RMSE.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn (install via `pip install`)

## Usage
1. Open the `Recommend_Movie.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, and train the recommendation model.
3. Evaluate the model and generate movie recommendations.

## Output
The notebook produces a list of recommended movies based on the input data and user preferences.

## Notes
- Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the notebook.
- Modify the dataset path in the notebook if necessary.
