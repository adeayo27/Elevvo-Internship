# Customer Segmentation

This project focuses on customer segmentation using machine learning techniques. The goal is to group customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing behavior and demographic information.

## Dataset
The dataset used contains customer information such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Annual Income
- Spending Score

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
        - Handled missing values.
        - Normalized numerical features for better model performance.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
        - Visualized relationships between features.
        - Identified patterns and trends in the data.

3. **Clustering**:
        - Applied the K-Means algorithm to segment customers.
        - Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

4. **Evaluation**:
        - Analyzed cluster characteristics to interpret customer groups.
        - Visualized clusters using 2D plots.

## Results
The analysis resulted in distinct customer segments, such as:
- High-income, high-spending customers.
- Low-income, low-spending customers.
- Moderate-income, average-spending customers.

## Conclusion
Customer segmentation provides valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Open `Customer_Segmentation.ipynb`.
2. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and results.
