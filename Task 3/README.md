# Forest_Cover.ipynb

This project is designed to analyze and classify forest cover types using machine learning techniques. It explores a dataset containing various environmental and geographical features to predict the type of forest cover in a given area. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizing relationships between features and target variables.
- **Model Training**: Implementing classification algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and others.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Open `Forest_Cover.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train models, and evaluate results.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains features such as elevation, soil type, and wilderness area. Ensure the dataset is available in the specified path before running the notebook.

## Results
The notebook provides insights into the most important features influencing forest cover type and demonstrates the performance of various classification models.
